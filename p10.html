  <strong><h2 align=center>“FREQUENCE MONITOR USING 8051 MC”:</h2></strong><hr>
  <p>This project represents an effective technique for the user to
monitor the frequency which user can control module by the use of Pot and display it in LCD display.
“MM ANTENNA 5G SIMULATION”: A simple rectangular patch antenna operating in the unlicensed
millimeter wave band is presented. The proposed antenna resonates at 38GHz with the corresponding return loss
of -31dB, covering about 4GHz bandwidth which makes it a suitable candidate for the next generation (5G)
wireless communication devices.
