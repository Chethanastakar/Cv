  <strong><h2 align=center>“YOLOV3 AND YOLOV4: MULTIPLE OBJECT DETECTION FOR SURVEILLANCE APPLICATIONS”:</h2></strong><hr>
  <p>Object detection algorithm such as You Only Look Once (YOLOv3 and YOLOv4) is
implemented for traffic and surveillance applications. A neural network consists of input minimum one hidden
and an output layer. Multiple object dataset (KITTI image and video), which consists of classes of images such
as Car, truck, person, and two-wheeler captured during RGB and grayscale images. The dataset is composed of
(image and video) of varying illumination. YOLO model variants such as YOLOv3 is implemented for image
and YOLOv4 for video dataset. Obtained results shows that the algorithm effectively detects objects
approximately with an accuracy of 98% for image dataset and 99% for video dataset.
