  <strong><h2 align=center>“PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF OBJECT DETECTION ALGORITHMS USING NEURAL NETWORK FRAMEWORK”:</h2></strong><hr>
  <p>Object detection is a process of density estimation in computer vision application such as traffic surveillance
application. Object recognition is an important task in computer vision, which indicates object type, class and
information of vehicles. Vehicle detection and type recognition in images are applicable for various operations
in a traffic system. Object detection algorithm such as convolution neural networks (CNN) and You Only Look
Once (YOLOv3) is implemented for traffic surveillance applications. The need for object detection in today’s
world has motivated us to implement an algorithm that can classify images and can detect objects. Object
detection can help in various fields such as video surveillance, security systems and in identifying objects and
having the ability to distinguish between them for planning purposes. The need of algorithms for surveillance is
of utmost importance in the creation of smart cities. The development of smart cities demands for object detection
mechanisms that can provide better ways to plan and maintain the ideas are tried to implement algorithms that
can perform detection of single, multiple and video dataset.
